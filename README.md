# 🍔 Crave

**Crave** is an iOS app for discovering, saving, and cooking recipes. The goal of the app is to make it easy to find meals you actually want to cook and to move smoothly from discovering recipes to cooking and enjoying them.

The app uses a swipe-based discovery experience for browsing new recipes, allows users to save favorites, and provides clear, step-by-step recipe instructions along with nutrition information.
